# Book Recommender System

In this project, we built a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering and matrix factorisation. We built a user-based collaborative filtering system, an item-based collaborative filtering system, and a matrix factorisation system. We evaluated the accuracy of the models using RMSE. Finally, we created an ensemble model that combines the user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering, and matrix factorisation models. The ensemble model was evaluated using RMSE. The results showed that the matrix factorisation model had a lower RMSE compared to the ensemble model. The ensemble model is a simple average of the three models and could be improved by using more sophisticated ensemble methods. Overall, the book recommendation system provides a robust recommendation engine that combines the strengths of the UBCF, IBCF, and MF models.
